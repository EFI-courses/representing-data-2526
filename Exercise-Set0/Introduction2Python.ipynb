    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this course is to introduce you to some of the theory and practice of data visualisation. Through these computational notebooks we will be covering some introductory ideas for coding in python, but particularly with a view to manipulating datasets and making visualisations using python language. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ideas we cover will be presented using specific datasets and modules (collections of tools), but these ideas are more generally applicable, and you will find several other modules that are used for data visualisation besides the ones we will talk about.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it first appeared in 1991, Python has become one of the most important programming languages today. For various historical and cultural reasons, Python has developed a large and active scientific computing and data analysis community. In the last 10 years, Python has gone from bleeding-edge and experimental to one of the most important languages for data science, machine learning and general software development in academia and industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers a lot of versatile tools for data manipulation and visualisation which are added in the form of modules (which are sets of tools you can import and use). \n",
    "\n",
    "The main ones we will talk about and use are Pandas and Altair. But before diving into Altair world, you will see some reminders from matplotlib and seaborn examples on data visualization tasks. For your portfolio examples or projects, you are free to prefer to choose specific tool, as long as their functionalities are aligning with your goal. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Noteable\n",
    "\n",
    "Noteable is simply the university's service that hosts your computational notebooks in one simple online hub. We will be using Python (notebooks) on Noteable, instead of installing Python on your computers, because it makes the logistics much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook is this current web-based interface that looks like a notebook and has text and code together. The code we write here is in Python language. The code and text are live here, meaning that you can run and edit them. To edit any block of text or code, double-click on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Useful Operations \n",
    "\n",
    "You can find these in the menus above - these are the main things you might need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Run** - To run code or text in a cell. You can also press `Shift+Enter` on your keyboard.\n",
    "- **Save** - To save the notebook click on the small disk icon. Always do that before leaving your notebook.\n",
    "- **Clearing all output** - `Kernel/Restart & Clear output`\n",
    "- **Deleting a block** - `Edit/Delete Cell`\n",
    "- **Saving a notebook locally to your own computer** - `File/Download As/Notebook(.ipynb)`\n",
    "- **Closing** - not recommended to close a notebook by closing the window. You should close it from the toolbar `File/Close and Halt`.\n",
    "- **Stop**: OR \"interrupt the kernel\" to stop the notebook from doing calculations if it is taking too long because of a coding mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore the other buttons at the top panel as well (File - Edit - ... - Help) whenever you have time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Please ask lots of questions!\n",
    "\n",
    "Coding can be hard, particularly if you have done little of it before. It is very common to start writing code and find that a lot of time is spent where it simply doesn't work - this is completely normal! \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to understand where things have gone wrong and systematically adjust and fix them to get the output you want is a large part of working with code. This is something the instructors on the course can help with - please do ask questions of us, but also to each other, and pitch in your answers if you see some questions you can solve as well.\n",
