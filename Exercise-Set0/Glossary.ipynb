    "Python, as a programming language, offers the flexibility to build custom solutions for data visualization, letting you tailor analyses to your specific data and research questions. You can use different options such as Seaborn or Altair (that the course focuses on), or some other options such as plotly module or others.

    "    y='y:Q',  # specify quantitative data\n",
    ")`.\n",

    " • [A method to overlay multiple charts on top of one another within the same coordinate space.](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/compound_charts.html#layered-multi-view-charts)  \n",
    " • Use: Combine different marks (such as points over a line) to provide additional context or annotations. To illustrate it may look like\n",
    " `alt.layer(\n",
    "  base.mark_line(),\n",
    "  base.mark_point(),\n",

    " • [Splits data into multiple sub-charts (facets) based on one or more fields.](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/generated/channels/altair.Facet.html)  \n",
    " • Use: Create small multiple views for comparing subgroups within your data, each with its own independent plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `interactive()`  \n",
    " • [Adds built-in interactivity (pan, zoom, tooltips) to a chart.]()  \n",

    " • [Filters the underlying data based on a query or condition directly within the chart definition.](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/transform/index.html)  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is often necessary to transform or filter data in the process of visualizing it. In Altair you can do this one of two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Before the chart definition, using standard pandas data transformations.\n",
    "    2. Within the chart definition, using Vega-Lite’s data transformation tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, we suggest that you use the first approach, because it is more straightforward to those who are familiar with data manipulation in Python, and because the pandas package offers much more flexibility than Vega-Lite in available data manipulations. The second approach becomes useful when the data source is not a dataframe, but, for example, a URL pointer to a JSON or CSV file. It can also be useful in a compound chart where different views of the dataset require different transformations.\n",
    " \n",
    "For example, `transform_filter()` serves to select a subset of data based on a condition or `transform_calculate()`is useful to create a new data column using an arithmetic calculation on an existing column.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `save()`  \n",
    " • [A function that allows you to export your chart to various formats (HTML, PNG, JSON).](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/saving_charts.html)  \n",
    " • Use: Preserve and share your final visualizations, for example, `chart.save('chart.png')`.\n",

    "### Main Steps of Altair-based Data Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Libraries**\n",
    "   - Import necessary libraries such as Altair and Pandas to handle data and create visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prepare Your Data**\n",
    "   - Load and prepare your data using Pandas, ensuring it's in a suitable format for visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create a Base Chart**\n",
    "   - Use [`alt.Chart()`](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/generated/toplevel/altair.Chart.html) to define a base chart with your DataFrame as the starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Choose a Mark Type**\n",
    "   - Select the type of visualization (e.g., bar, line, scatter) using the appropriate [`mark_*`](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/marks/index.html) method. Such as; `mark_line()`, `mark_point()`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Encode Data**\n",
    "   - Map data fields to visual properties like axes, colors, and sizes using the [`encode()`](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/encodings/index.html#encoding-data-types) method.\n",

    "## Common Troubleshooting Tips \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "**1. [Package Installation and Imports](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/)**   \n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure required packages are installed using pip if you are using some local environment (e.g., pip install pandas).   \n",
    "- Verify that you are importing packages correctly (e.g., import pandas as pd). \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. [Syntax and Typographical Errors](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/13-Common-Python-Errors.html)**   \n",
    "\n",
    "- Check for spelling mistakes in function names and variable identifiers.   \n",
    "- Ensure you follow proper Python syntax, including indentation, parentheses, and commas. \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. [Reading Error Messages](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)**   \n",
    "\n",
    "- Read traceback error messages carefully—they often indicate the source and nature of the problem.   \n",
    "- Use the error details to search online for solutions or refer to the package’s documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Data Compatibility Issues**   \n",
    "\n",
    "- When using pandas, confirm that your data types are appropriate (e.g., numerical data for plotting).   \n",
    "- Use functions like `df.info()` and `df.describe()` to inspect your DataFrame structure before visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Debugging Techniques**   \n",
    "\n",
    "- Use print statements or the debugger (e.g., Python’s built-in pdb module) to inspect variable values and code flow.   \n",
    "- For interactive environments (like Jupyter Notebook), use cell-by-cell execution to identify where issues arise. \n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Documentation and Community Support**   \n",
    "\n",
    "- Refer to official documentation for pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and other libraries for usage examples and best practices.   \n",
    "- Utilize community forums (e.g., Stack Overflow, GitHub issues) to troubleshoot common problems or use examples from Python content platforms such as [RealPython](https://realpython.com/). "
